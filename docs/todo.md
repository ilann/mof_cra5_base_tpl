A possible 3rd party lib for working with iframes
[React <Frame /> component](https://github.com/ryanseddon/react-frame-component)


# 18-dec-2021

*Toward a Domain jail*

Ultimate goals: The Host will construct a wrapper over the remote that will isolate it
in terms of shared res and routing.

[] Create a remote and use it
    [] cleanup for the current code
    [] push it

[] clone the code to a domain repository
    [] create a new domain reporotory in github
    [] adjust and push the domain code
   

    

[] consume a simple compoeent from the remote, to check that stuff is working.
[] consume a class from the remote.
    - it must be dynamic
    - that class will be server as a bridge/adapter
        and I'll be able to pull the remotes components from the adapter.

        
    - the bridge will be consumed as exgtenral lib - eventaully

    - If a Host a suffice to controll the remote in terms of what I want to achive
        then there is no need to the extenal lib

[] How to get iframe context

    [] via using Remotes where the iframe implemented over there

    [] check that lib <Frame> it has context

[] Create an in line iframe with some react component and check if it has local storage.

    [] pahse 1 - simple compoenent that is encapsulared with iframe
            -- do I have seperate local storage?

    [] pahse 2 - using React portals

[] I need to see if I get encapsulated local storage and routing

    [] if if I do have encapsulated local storage
        then I'll proceed to consume a remote and check the next stuff
            []

## Future proofing

## Impact of 3rd party libs via domain
a 3rd lib migh try to do somthing that breaks

## Common adapter for common API
efvery api should expose the same api

## Do not fail when a domain fails
    dynamic loading every resource

## Notification

## Error handling

## Shared resource protection (URL, LocalStorage...)
proxy?

## Routing


## Tabs

## Webpack dynimac resources
